from the interwebz:
To pasteurize hot sauce, aim for a temperature of at least 180°F (82°C) and hold it for 10 minutes, ensuring the sauce is acidic (pH 4.6 or below) to kill bacteria. 

or to sterilize bottles, heat in oven at 200F for 20-30 minutes

For shelf-stable hot sauce, you must sterilize the bottles beforehand by heating them to 180-200°F for at least 25 minutes and then filling them while hot, followed by flipping them upside down to help create a vacuum seal and further sterilize the lids. This process helps ensure the hot sauce remains safe for long-term storage without refrigeration.
