Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan.

Mix sugar, flour, melted butter, eggs, cocoa powder, vanilla, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl until combined. Fold in chopped walnuts. Spread the batter into the prepared pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 20 to 30 minutes; cool before slicing into squares.
