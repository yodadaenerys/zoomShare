Ingredients
4 cups fresh raspberries, divided
    1.5x = 6 c
½ cup water
    1.5x = 3/4 c
2 tablespoons cornstarch
    1.5x = 3
¼ cup cold water

½ cup white sugar

1 tablespoon lemon juice

1 (9 inch) ready-to-use refrigerated pie crust

1 cup whipped cream for garnish

1 teaspoon lemon zest for garnish

Cook 1 cup raspberries and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until raspberries soften, about 5 minutes. Strain mixture into a bowl through a fine mesh sieve; discard seeds. Return mashed berries to the saucepan.

Stir cornstarch into 1/4 cup cold water in a bowl until dissolved. Pour mixture into the saucepan and mix with mashed berries. Stir in sugar. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Let cool to room temperature, 15 to 25 minutes.

Pour remaining 3 cups raspberries into pie crust. Pour raspberry sauce over top and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.

Ingredients
1 (14.1 ounce) package double-crust pie pastry, thawed

4 cups raspberries
    1.5x = 6 c

1 cup white sugar
    1.5x = 1.5 c

2 ½ tablespoons tapioca
    1.5x = 3.25 c

1 tablespoon lemon juice
    1.5x = 2 t

¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon

⅛ teaspoon salt

4 teaspoons butter
    1.5x = 6 t

1 tablespoon half-and-half cream

Directions
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie plate with one pie crust.

Mix raspberries, sugar, tapioca, lemon juice, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl until raspberries are well coated; pour into pie crust and dot with butter.

Cover filling with remaining pie crust; flute edges to seal. Brush cream on top, then cut several slits to allow steam to escape.

Bake pie in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake until crust is golden and filling is bubbly, about 30 to 35 minutes more. Allow pie to cool completely before serving.
