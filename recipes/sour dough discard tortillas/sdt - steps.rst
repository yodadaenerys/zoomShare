In a large bowl, whisk together 250 g sourdough discard, 160 g warm water, and 75 g avocado oil until well combined. 
Slowly add in 400 g all-purpose flour and 6 g sea salt, mixing until a dough forms. It should feel soft and not sticky to the touch. 
Let the dough rest for 30 minutes to relax.
After resting, divide the dough into twelve 75g balls.
Roll each dough ball into your ideal tortilla size using a rolling pin. Don't be afraid to use lots of flour to prevent the dough from sticking to your rolling pin and surface. 
If the dough is really resisting being rolled, cover and let rest another 10-15 minutes so the gluten relaxes.
