Butter – use unsalted butter to sautee onions
Yellow onion – it seems like a ton of onion but it dissapears into the soup adding a balanced sweetness
Garlic – you’ll need 1 Tbsp minced from about 3 cloves
Crushed tomatoes – with their juice, preferably San Marzano tomatoes
Chicken stock – for the best flavor use homemade chicken broth
Basil – chop and add 1/4 cup fresh basil, plus more to serve. Basil leaves are easily bruised so chop by stacking a bunch of leaves then roll them into a log and cut into thin strips.
Sugar – It’s just 1 Tbsp, but necessary to combat the tomato acidity.
Black pepper – start with 1/2 tsp and add more to taste
Whipping cream – adds a creaminess to the soup and offsets acidity.
Parmesan cheese – adds saltiness to the soup and balances acidity. Adding parmesan adds enough salt and I usually don’t add more.
