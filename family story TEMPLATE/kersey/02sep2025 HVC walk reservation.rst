steps
# check existing reservation
# check availability of resort at current reservation +1 (bar should be dark/available, not light/outside range)
# cancel existing reservation
# check for inventory to be marked available (~10 mins?), refresh the page between checks
# note: the fact that there is no availability shown during the timeframe cancelled likely means only 1 room is    available.
        this reduces risk of losing the dates to others with the same booking window, since there is no minimum booking available.
# once dates become available, highlight new desired dates and click book now.
