as some of you who know me may recall,
i've been quitting this game for a long time now
at first, it was when all 3 of my accounts reached lvl40 (apr2019)
then, i was going to quit when i caught my first boosted shiny legendary (feb2021)
then when we had completed 10,000 legendary raids (may2021)
then once all of my accounts were lvl40 (jun2023)
most recently when each of my accounts had a perfect shiny legendary (yesterday)
well, i'm not sure if there will be a next goal...

awe eff it, one more goal, 
12 more legendary raids for #6 to reach 2,0000...
