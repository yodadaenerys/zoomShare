am i doing this right?

how often have you asked yourself that?

i found reframe in early january, after deciding to try dryJanuary.
i was planning for AF, but switched to cutback.
after getting involved, i decided to stick around beyond january.
yay!
but now, my version of cutback has become 'plan to drink on somedays, and abstain on others'.

i keep moving the bar out.
'every other weekend' becomes 'every 4th day'.
our demons are so sneaky, right?

i hear some here speak of 'failing', or succumbing to temptations.
but, my temptations are not "in this moment, i must have a drink".
my temptations are, 'yea, i know we said that, but this sounds easier'

i am almost certain this has not inspired you to do better.
i am sorry, or you are welcome, if i am wrong.
